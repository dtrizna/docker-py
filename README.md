# Example of Python applications executed as Docker container

This toy infrastructure starts custom Python Load Balancer (just round robin), several custom Python HTTP servers and Redis DB (won't run in repo, as there's no `/var/cec/redis.rdb` dump file).

Examples are provided either with or without Docker Compose usage.
